<h2 style="color: aquamarine"> ODBC Driver</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is a standard interface for connecting to databases. An ODBC driver serves as a bridge between an application and a database (AZURE SQL DATABASE, in this case), allowing the application to communicate with the database using the ODBC API. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Make sure you have the appropriate ODBC driver installed on your system. This tool supports the x64 version of ODBC Driver version 17 and 18. New versions will be added if they are released in the future.
If not installed, you can download the driver either from the link provided below or by clicking on the "INSTALL DRIVER" button within the program once you have gotten it running.
